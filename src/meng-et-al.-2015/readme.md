# Data For "Physically Meaningful Rendering using Tristimulus Colours"

These two files are copies of those that were helpfully provided by Meng et al. in their EGSR 2015 paper "Physically Meaningful Rendering using Tristimulus Colours".  The data was downloaded from one of the author's [website](https://jo.dreggn.org/home/)s.

We had to make minor modifications to get them to compile: they use variable-length arrays, which are invalid in C++.

A copy of the paper per-se can be found [on the same site](https://jo.dreggn.org/home/2015_spectrum.pdf).
